## üöÄ Architecture & Technical Highlights

This project was built with a strong emphasis on clean, scalable, and maintainable code.

- **Feature-Driven Architecture**: The codebase is organized into features (`launches`, `favorites`, `onboarding`, etc.), making it modular and easy to navigate.
- **Advanced State Management**: State is managed using the `flutter_bloc` package, following best practices:
  - **Sealed Class States**: All complex states (`LaunchesState`, `FavoritesState`) are modeled using `sealed classes` for maximum type safety and compile-time checks.
  - **Dedicated Cubits**: Each piece of state is managed by its own dedicated Cubit (`LaunchesCubit`, `ThemeCubit`, `ViewModeCubit`), respecting the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Centralized Services**: All interactions with external services (API, local storage) are handled by dedicated service classes (`LaunchService`, `StorageService`, `FavoriteService`), ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
- **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies (like services) are injected into the Cubits, making the code decoupled and highly testable.
- **Clean UI Code**: The UI is built with a clear separation between presentation logic and business logic. Helper methods (`_buildBody`) are used to keep the build methods readable, and reusable components (`LaunchListItem`, `ThemeRadioTile`) are extracted into their own files.
